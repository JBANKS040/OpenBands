- compare salaries with coworker without disclosing it. Only reveal whos is higher // yaos millionaire problem

- aggregated data. show salaries for a company only if 10+ submissions are reached
Aggregation is a trivial MPC task. No performance bottlenecks, no trusted party. Everyone submits encrypted data, and the system reveals only the group statistics. No one ever sees individual salaries—not even during computation.


- To make it even stronger, you can layer in differential privacy.
This adds noise in a controlled way, so even if someone tries to reverse-engineer individual entries from the aggregate, it doesn’t work.
