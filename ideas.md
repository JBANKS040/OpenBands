- I wonder if you could connect with http://openbanking.nr so that salaries are constrained too ðŸ¤”


- generate key and post submission later, e.g. after leaving the company
- personal company feedback pro/con: text field

- compare salaries with coworker without disclosing it. Only reveal whos is higher // yaos millionaire problem

- aggregated data. show salaries for a company only if 10+ submissions are reached
Aggregation is a trivial MPC task. No performance bottlenecks, no trusted party. Everyone submits encrypted data, and the system reveals only the group statistics. No one ever sees individual salariesâ€”not even during computation.


- To make it even stronger, you can layer in differential privacy.
This adds noise in a controlled way, so even if someone tries to reverse-engineer individual entries from the aggregate, it doesnâ€™t work.
